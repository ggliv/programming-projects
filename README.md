# ggliv's programming projects
### Bite-sized projects meant to teach me more about how to code.

## About
I've been getting the itch to properly dive into coding since the beginning of quarantine but haven't kept myself to it when I give it a shot.

This repo is my attempt to keep myself accountable by putting my efforts out into the open. I plan to push at least one complete project here every week.

Implementations will likely be in Python for convenience but I might do some in other languages if I want to learn something new or think it would be work better in that language.

## Contribution
Since this is more of a personal thing, I won't be accepting any pull requests. If you see any problems with my code though, feel free to open an issue or leave a comment on the commit.

If you'd like to suggest a project for me to take a shot at, feel free to open an issue with its name and description. The more fun it looks to do, the more likely I'll be to pick it up.
